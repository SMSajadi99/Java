# Java

Java is a flagship, high-level, all-purpose programming language that runs on a variety of operating systems. Java can be called the mother tongue of the Solaris operating system. The main feature of the Java programming language is its object-orientation, which means that it is possible to re-use pre-written code in this language. In this regard, the main motto of Java: "Write once and use it everywhere" is a very important topic. Another plus of this programming language is that people familiar with C ++ can learn JAVA easier and faster.
